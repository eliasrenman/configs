# TADA68 layout for ISO-NOR

> My ISO-style layout for a Swdish keyboard keyboards.

This layout has Mac compatibility.

### Specifics

As it's an ISO style keymap, it works with the fat double-row `Enter` key and the narrower left `Shift` and `<>` key. In addition, it switches the `'` key and the `Â´` key since the latter one is less common in Norwegian, and the first one normally is placed where the `Escape` key is located on a TADA68.

## Installation

Please see the [tada68 readme](../../readme.md) using the following command

```
make tada68:iso-nor:bin
```
